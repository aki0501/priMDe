# PriMDe
A website aimed to connect LGBTQ+ members of the community to non-discriminatory healthcare.

Since we didn't get to fully implement our idea, we also made a presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19hCA8buJCcpZDrf7qkeJQIQflkfQ52HJdFVii5efQBQ/edit?usp=sharing

Created with Emily Liang, Zinnia Kwan, and Joana Fang, for the 2023 QWER Hacks Hackathon at UCLA.
